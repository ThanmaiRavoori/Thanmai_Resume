Hello, 
I am Thanmai.I want to tell you something about my previous work experience.
I worked as an Associate Java Developer for PwC(PriceWaterhouseCoopers) for about an hear and half.
I worked for two projects and was more into production support.
Though I have only an year and half of experience, I learnt a lot over there.
